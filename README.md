### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MotazAbdou. Junior Software Developer, residing in Waterford, Ireland.

I have recently completed my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development, and I'm very eager to embark on a career in the software development industry and gain professional experience.

I came into the industry as a Mechanical Engineer by profession, initially seeking to improve my digital marketing knowledge, until I quickly discovered the fascinating world of programming, which has ultimately turned into a passion of mine. The artist in me found an incredible means to express my creativity, designs and ideas, and the logical, critical thinker and problem solver in me knew that coding fulfils that side of me. Luckily for me, Web Development exists and appeases both these sides.

My goal in this journey is fairly simple; to continue learning, to be a student for as long as it takes to become a teacher. To absorb as much knowledge and skill as I can from those my senior and to become the best developer I can be. I truly relish any opportunity to learn and grow, with my ultimate goal being the delivery of accessible applications which conform to modern web standards..

### ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... Coding!

I had already taken an interest in coding in 2015 during my phase as a digital marketer, having learned front-end development, but I have decided to retrain more seriously in the software development industry during 2021, broadening my knowledge base as a full-stack developer, and widening my understanding of front-end and back-end languages, tools, libraries and frameworks. I intend to bring expertise in problem-solving and to create innovative solutions.
